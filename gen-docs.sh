#!/bin/bash

# ========================================================================================================
# Script Purpose:
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This script processes the commit history of a base Git branch and generates new commits on a tracking
# branch (`gen-commits`). Each new commit will have two parents: the current base commit and the last
# generated commit on the tracking branch. The script runs a specified external command to generate files
# based on the diff between the base commit and its parent, then stages and commits the generated files.
#
# ========================================================================================================
# Usage:
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Configure the base branch (default: 'remotes/origin/main') and tracking branch (default: 'gen-commits').
# 2. Run the script in a Git repository with the external command specified.
# 3. The script processes one commit at a time from the base branch, generates new files, and commits them
#    to the tracking branch with the correct parentage.
#
# Example:
#    ./this-script.sh
#
# ========================================================================================================
# General Strategy:
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. The script checks if the tracking branch exists, creates it from the first commit on the base branch
#    if necessary.
# 2. Iterates over the commits in the base branch. For each commit, generates files based on the commit's
#    changes, then commits these files to the tracking branch.
# 3. Keeps track of the last generated base commit, allowing for incremental runs.
#
